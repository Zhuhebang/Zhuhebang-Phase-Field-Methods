# Welcome! 
&mu;-PRO, or MUPRO, ferroelectric module is a phase-field software package for the simulation of polarization domain evolution within ferroelectric materials.
This online version is not fully finished yet, you can also refer to this [pdf documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vTSN4-e4hL5_zDHluY1VeqLuqx-ijljG/view?usp=sharing) for more information.
## Preface
This manual is for the &mu;-Ferro module of phase field package &mu;-ProÂ®. 
&mu;-Ferro is a phase-field method based program to simulate the electric polarization evolution in ferroelectric materials under external fields. 
Users are recommended to have basic knowledge about ferroelectric materials. Though programming experiences are not necessary, 
basic knowledge of LINUX operations are necessary, as currently only the linux executable is released.
This  manual  starts  with  a  brief  introduction  and  a  simple  example  to  get  the  reader started.  
Followed by a detailed introduction of different input files,  output data and pre/-post processing scripts. 
Next, all of the parameters that can be set using the input.in file are listed and explained in detail.
The manual is mainly a reference guide and explains most files and control flags imple-mented in the code.
A complete description of the underlying algorithms and theories can befound in the recommended reference in [resources](/resources/references/).
