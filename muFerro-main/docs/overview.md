# Overview

After almost 20 years of gradual development in the research code, in 2020 we released the first version of Mu-PRO ferroelectric, which is the world first commercial ferroelectric phase-field simulation program.

In 2023, we are having a major update to the ferroelectric program along with the release of our PhaseFieldSDK. Now, instead of sell the whole executable, we sell the close-sourced SDK and open sourced the main program, so that users have the capability to modify and compile the main program at their will.

The tutorial section contains information about how you can start building your own main programs.

The examples section contains explanation of details in the provided main programs.
